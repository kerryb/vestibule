<%= page_title "The Vestibule Process" %>

<p>The idea is simple. You <a href="#proposals" data-toggle="tab">propose a talk</a>. Others will help you <a href="#suggestions" data-toggle="tab">refine and focus it by making <em>suggestions</em></a>. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.</p>

<p>At some point (yet to be determined), we&rsquo;ll then <a href="#selections" data-toggle="tab">collectively vote for the set of proposals</a> we want to see given on the day.</p>

<p>This year we&rsquo;re making the process <a href="/anonymous-proposals">completely anonymous for anyone who wants to submit a talk</a>. That means your proposal will be judged purely on the basis of its content â€” not on your name, your face, whether you&rsquo;re on the usual conference circuit, or any other criteria with the potential to distract from what the talk is about.</p>

      <h1>Writing a proposal</h1>

      <p>DevCon is nothing without your talk proposals.  We think that almost everyone has something interesting to talk about, so please think about that fun or unusual or difficult or surprising thing you&rsquo;ve done recently and submit a talk (or several talks!) to DevCon so we can hear about it.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>What can I talk about?</h2>

        <p>You may propose a talk about whatever you like.  If the audience are interested in your suggestion, your proposal will be successful <%= link_to 'in the voting', '#selections' %> and you will get to give the talk on the day.  If they&rsquo;re not interested, your proposal will sink slowly and inexorably into oblivion and nobody will ever know the truth of what happened.</p>

        <p>Even if you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable giving a talk yourself (although there&rsquo;s no reason you shouldn&rsquo;t!), you can still submit proposals of things you&rsquo;d like to hear about. These are particularly useful as it&rsquo;s not always obvious what the potential audience is looking for, and there are often people who would like to speak but aren&rsquo;t sure what people would like to hear. Just make it clear in your proposal that it&rsquo;s a suggestion for someone else and hopefully someone will step forward and propose a talk on that subject (try not to volunteer in the coments, to preserve some semblance of anonymity).</p>

        <p>You should take a look at <%= link_to 'list of things people are hoping to get out of DevCon', motivation_path %> for some inspiration.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How long should my talk be?</h2>

        <p>Talks should generally be 30 minutes, plus 10 minutes Q&A, but if you have something interesting that can be said in less time, that&rsquo;s great too. We&rsquo;ll build the schedule around the best proposals chosen by the community.<p>

        <p>We&rsquo;ll have some five-minute lightning talks too. Also, as well as straight talks, practical sessions always go down well &ndash; these will generally be a bit longer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Who will I be talking to?</h2>

        <p>Your audience will consist of people who are interested in coming to DevCon: this mostly means BT developers in Adastral Park and the surrounding area. There will be a wide range of experience, from new apprentices and graduates to grizzled BT veterans, as well as some people who aren't active developers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why should I give a talk?</h2>

        <p>In an environment as diverse as BT&rsquo;s, everyone has something interesting they could talk about, whether it&rsquo;s a language, tool or technique they&rsquo;ve tried, a project they&rsquo;ve worked on or something interesting they&rsquo;ve read or heard about. By talking at DevCon you&rsquo;ll get more exposire to your fellow developers, and it will make a good bullet point for &ldquo;contributing to the community&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re filling in your <strike>bullsh</strike>evidence.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How anonymous does my proposal have to be?</h2>

        <p>Although the proposal system <%= link_to 'is completely anonymous', anonymous_proposals_path %>, we can&rsquo;t prevent you from including identifying information either within the proposal itself or on the wider internet. Sometimes this is inevitable: if you want to give a talk about your experience as chief architect of the Foo platform from 2010 to 2012, it&rsquo;s not going to take too much detective work to reveal your identity. That&rsquo;s fine, and there&rsquo;s no need to go to ridiculous lengths to conceal your identity if it makes the proposal more difficult to write, but just respect the spirit of the process: as far as is sensible and practical, we would like for talks to be chosen because of what they&rsquo;re about, not because of who is giving them.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Do I have to go through with it if I propose something?</h2>

        <p>Of course not!  No one is going to force you to give a talk just because you proposed it!  You always have the option to withdraw your proposal if change your mind or discover you can&rsquo;t make it to the conference.</p>

    <article id="suggestions" class="tab-pane">
      <h1>Feedback on proposals</h1>

      <p>Once a proposal is submitted, people will be able to leave comments on it, and the proposer will be able to respond.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>What do I do with suggestions on my proposals?</h2>

        <p>There are many ways to deal with suggestions.  You <em>can</em> simply ignore them - but we think you&rsquo;ll write a better talk and get more out of the process if you actively engage with them.  You can respond with your own comments (which will remain anonymous), you can tweak your proposal to accommodate them, or to explicitly rule them out.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What sort of suggestions should I make about a proposal?</h2>

        <p>Read the proposal in detail and provide feedback about how you think it could be clarified or improved.  Ask questions about what it will involve.  Be constructive and explain what needs to happen in order for the proposal to become something you&rsquo;re willing to vote for.</p>

        <p>Try to avoid simple &ldquo;+1&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes, sounds good.&rdquo; style suggestions as they don&rsquo;t give the proposer anything useful to work with.  Say <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re &ldquo;+1&rdquo;-ing the proposal - there&rsquo;s got to be a reason and it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve assumed they&rsquo;ll cover something that they weren&rsquo;t planning to.</p>

    <article id="selections" class="tab-pane">
      <h1>Selecting proposals</h1>

      <p>After we have feedback on all the proposals, we will stop accepting new talks and allow people to cast their votes about which talks they want to see on the day.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>How do talks get chosen?</h2>

        <p>This part is simple: anyone who signs up to Vestibule gets to pick the lineup they want to see on the day, with one vote for each available slot. Once the votes are in, the proposals with the most votes get picked, we inform the proposers that they have been successful, and we reveal the identities of the speakers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What happens if my talk doesn&rsquo;t get chosen?</h2>

        <p>Unsuccessful proposals will remain anonymous.  Feel free to use all the feedback from the community to rework your proposal and submit it another time, or just book a room or set up a LiveMeeting and do it as a community knowledge call!</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What happens if my talk does get chosen?</h2>

        <p>We&rsquo;ll be in touch to confirm that you really are happy to give the talk.  It&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;ll be no hard feelings.  If you want to get some feedback about your talk in advance, someone will be happy to go over it with you, but equally if you don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;ll trust you to do a great job anyway.</p>
