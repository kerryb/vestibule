  <%= page_title 'What is DevCon?' %>

  <p>DevCon is a one-day community-organised internal conference for the BT and Inoovation Martlesham developer community to share knowledge and experience. The day consists of a series of talks proposed and chosen by the people in the community, usually followed by a trip to the pub afterwards!</p>

  <p>The idea of DevCon is to get the software community together to talk about interesting things and learn about a few things that maybe you thought BT developers never did! In the past we&rsquo;ve had talks like <em>Developing Skynet (or an introduction to machine learning)</em> and <em>Docker - The future of application delivery?</em>. This year we have also opened up the invite to the other companies in the Innovation Martlesham cluster and have had a talk proposed by the previous head of testing across digital for News UK.</p>

  <p>If all of this sounds interesting to you, sign in and have a look at the proposals; if you&rsquo;re feeling extra brave you can even propose a talk! If you sign in we will keep you up to date with information about the event like when the proposals are open for voting on and the schedule for the day.</p>

  <p>DevCon X is scheduled for November 27th (probably  from around 9am until 4pm), so keep that day free if you&rsquo;re interested in attending. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to <a href="mailto:devcon-plotting@ossig.bt.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

  <h2>What is Vestibule?</h2>

  <p>Vestibule (this site) is a tool to help us &mdash; the community &mdash; generate and prepare the contents of the day (blatantly stolen from <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor</a>).</p>

  <p>The idea is simple. You propose a presentation. Others will help you refine and focus it by making <em>suggestions</em>. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.</p>

  <p>At some point (yet to be determined), we&rsquo;ll then collectively whittle down the set of proposals to those that have been selected for the day.</p>
