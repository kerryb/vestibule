  <h1>What is DevCon?</h1>

  <p>DevCon is a one-day community-organised internal conference for the BT developer community to share knowledge and experience. The day consists of a series of talks proposed and chosen by the people in the community (that&rsquo;s you)</p>

  <p>The idea of DevCon is to get the software community together to talk about interesting things and learn about a few things that maybe you thought BT developers never did! In the past, when we&rsquo;ve run this kind of event before, we&rsquo;ve had talks on topics as diverse as experiences with new  languages, machine learning, if-less programming and even (non-work) projects involving search and rescue drones. Basically, if it&rsquo;s related to software development, it could be a DevCon topic.</p>

  <p>The event will (finally!) take place on Friday 13 March, 2020. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to <a href="devcon-plotting@devlists.bt.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;d like to come to DevCon, please <a href="http://snip.bt.com/join-devcon">sign up</a>. We&rsquo;ll be announcing the talks soon.</p>

  <h2>What is Vestibule?</h2>

  <p>Vestibule (this site) is a tool to help us &ndash; the community &ndash; generate and prepare the contents of the day (the system is blatantly stolen from <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested).</p>

  <p>The idea is simple. You propose a presentation. Others will help you refine and focus it by making <em>suggestions</em>. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.</p>

  <p>At some point, you&rsquo;ll be able to vote for the presentations you&rsquo;d most like to see. We&rsquo;ll then collectively whittle down the set of proposals to those that have been selected for the day.</p>
